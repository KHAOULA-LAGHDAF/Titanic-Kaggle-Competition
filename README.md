# Titanic-Kaggle-Competition

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using the well-known Titanic dataset from the Kaggle competition. The notebook encompasses a comprehensive analysis and classification of the "Survivors" column, leveraging various machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Scope
The notebook begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. Key features influencing survival rates are identified, and missing data is addressed through appropriate imputation strategies.
Following the EDA, multiple machine learning models are implemented, fine-tuned, and evaluated to enhance predictive accuracy. The models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

## Key Components
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and analyzing key features that impact survival rates.
Modeling and Evaluation: Training and testing multiple machine learning models, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
Final Model Selection: Choosing the best-performing model based on cross-validation results and test accuracy.
## Results
The final model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, effectively classifying passengers based on their likelihood of survival. The notebook provides a detailed breakdown of each step, making it a valuable resource for those looking to understand and apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.
